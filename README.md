Download the dataset from the kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small, I have used the dataset with 44,000 images and the image quality is compromised, due to the complexity involved if anyone are interested in training the model with good amount of data and have good resources use this dataset which have more quality data(images)-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset. The model is effcient and I was able to run in the local host, but unable to run on the cloud using streamlit platform I am unable to recover the image path -https://3rf8wnjq2wbzbtv4uw3n64.streamlit.app/ (I will be working on that). The app.py is perfectly running in the local host, eventually I have posted some sample inputs and ouputs in the repository.
